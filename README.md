# Analysis and forecasting of levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> fine particulate matter pollution in the air of Chinese cities

This repository provides a Python notebook that demonstrates a basic exploratory analysis of the time-series data as well as a few simple forecasting models, using popular data science packages.

The dataset used is "PM<sub>2.5</sub> Data of Five Chinese Cities" described in:

    Liang, X., S. Li, S. Zhang, H. Huang, and S. X. Chen (2016), 
    PM2.5 data reliability, consistency, and air quality assessment 
    in five Chinese cities, J. Geophys. Res. Atmos., 121, 
    10,220â€“10,236, doi: 10.1002/2016JD024877.


You may run the notebook itself (`five_chinese_cities.ipynb`) or read an HTML article generated from it (`five_chinese_cities.html`)
